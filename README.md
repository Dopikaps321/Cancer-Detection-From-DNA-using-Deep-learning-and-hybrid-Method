# Cancer-Detection-From-DNA-using-Deep-learning-and-hybrid-Method
Detecting various types of cancer from DNA sequences using deep learning models. By leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and a Hybrid CNN-LSTM model, the system aims to accurately classify cancer types based on high-dimensional genetic data.

## ðŸš€ Project Overview
Early detection of cancer significantly increases treatment success. This project uses deep learning techniques to identify mutations in DNA sequences that are linked to specific cancer types. The models are trained on real-world data sourced from **The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives
- Build an AI-driven system to detect cancer types from DNA sequence data.
- Compare the performance of traditional CNN and a Hybrid CNN-LSTM model.
- Improve accuracy and generalization using robust training and optimization techniques.
